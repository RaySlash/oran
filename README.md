# Oran
A simple text editor made in rust. This is currently WIP. I am writing this to improve my knowledge in computing. This is a flake.

### Usage
```shell
nix develop
cargo build
```

### TODO
- Print inputs on new buffer
- Implement tree-sitter
- Ability to save and open files
- Avoid clearing terminal on exit

### Credits
- Huge Thanks to [Flenker](https://www.flenker.blog) for his blog on the same topic.
